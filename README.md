### Font
The font used throughout the website is "Noto Serif", which is implemented through Google Fonts.  
Since it is important for the quiz that all questions and answers can be read and understood quickly, the clean and readable design of "Noto Serif" is a great advantage. Through the balanced proportions and consistent spacing, everything looks visually very pleasing.
